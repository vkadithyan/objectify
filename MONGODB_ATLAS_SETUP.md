# üçÉ MongoDB Atlas Setup Guide for Objectify

Follow these steps to set up your own MongoDB Atlas cluster and connect it to your Objectify application.

## Step 1: Create MongoDB Atlas Account

1. Go to [https://cloud.mongodb.com/](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Click "Try Free" or "Sign Up"
3. Create your account with email/password or sign up with Google

2. Choose **"M0 Sandbox"** (Free tier - perfect for development)
3. Select your preferred cloud provider and region (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
4. Give your cluster a name (e.g., "objectify-cluster")
5. Click "Create Cluster" (this takes 1-3 minutes)

## Step 3: Create Database User

1. In the left sidebar, click "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Choose "Password" authentication
4. Create a username (e.g., "objectify-user")
5. Generate a secure password (save this!)

7. Click "Add User"

## Step 4: Configure Network Access

1. In the left sidebar, click "Network Access"

5. Copy the connection string (it looks like this):
   ```
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

## Step 6: Update Your Environment File

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` in the connection string with your actual credentials, and add the database name:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://objectify-user:your-password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/objectify?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## Step 7: Test Connection

Run the setup script to test your connection:
```bash
node test-mongodb-connection.js
```

## üéâ That's it!
